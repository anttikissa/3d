Importance:

1 - needed to make playing fun
2 - annoying things
3 - needed to make playing easier
4 - cosmetic things

Bugs:

0 Development isn't fun any more
  - make reloading code / testing changes instantaneous 
  - make it less GPU-hoggy optionally (i.e. just draw fewer polygons)

1 Sounds are missing

1 Can't shoot no bullets.

1 There are no enemies.

1 You can't see the fuel trails and it's difficult to see where you're moving
when you're flying high.

1 There's no missions or goal or anything.

1 Water might be fun.

2 Camera breaks when too much down/up.  Also q/e.

2 You can't really restart the game.

3 Hovering and landing need some autopilot magic.

4 Tweak land colors, etc.

4 Rendering the scene in multiple passes causes minor glitches when crossing the
boundary.
  - shadow is rendered wrongly when you're hovering on the boundary
  - opacity doesn't work when you see ground through your ship
